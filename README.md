# Factorio Blueprint Library

Contained in this repository is a set of blueprints and books for the construction game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/).  Many of these have been lifted ultimately from [Factorio Prints](https://factorioprints.com/), which I suggest you use.  I've mostly put them here to keep my own copies of things.

The repo here will be split into sections based on what the blueprints are for, and each directory will have in it a README which outlines any references for where the blueprint came from, and then a txt file for the blueprint itself.

Section | Purpose

[earlygame](earlygame) | Early Game Blueprints, startup books etc
[midgame](midgame) | Midgame production modules, not heavily beaconized
[lategame](lategame) | Lategame production modules, usually heavily beaconized
[onekspm](onekspm) | Blueprints for 1K SPM base design
