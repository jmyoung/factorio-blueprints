# Railway Blueprints

Various railway systems.  I've generally only considered RHD systems here, and focused on chunk-aligned systems.  Incompatible systems may be because of whether they align on the corner of a chunk or on the middle, or based on the rail spacing.  It should be possible to make adapters to fix this.
