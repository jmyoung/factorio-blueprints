# Railway Blueprints

Various railway systems.  I've generally only considered RHD systems here, and focused on chunk-aligned systems.  Incompatible systems may be because of whether they align on the corner of a chunk or on the middle, or based on the rail spacing.  It should be possible to make adapters to fix this.

[elderaxes_rhd_103](elderaxes_rhd_103.txt) | [FactorioPrints](https://factorioprints.com/view/-LfpQ63zCDlI03H8sH8_) | RHD, Chunk Corner Aligned, 2-rail spacing, upgradable from 2 to 4 lanes.  Wired for R&G circuits.
[sparr_rhd_141](sparr_rhd_141.txt) | [FactorioPrints](https://factorioprints.com/view/-L9l4fVWpLLjU-2TetZD) | RHD, Chunk Corner Aligned, 2-rail spacing, 2 lanes.  Made for 1-4-1 trains.  Has some pretty great stations.  *Not wired for R&G circuits*.
[haphollas_train_network](haphollas_train_network.txt) | [Nilaus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4VgZv35yUI&feature=youtu.be) | A logistics train network implemented in vanilla.  Only includes stations BPs, not a full rail system.

## Peregrinus' Modular Rail System v2 RHD

RHD, Not Chunk Aligned, 3-rail spacing.  Expandable from 2-4 lanes, and is otherwise quite complete.  Made for 3-6-3 trains or smaller.  Wired for R&G circuits.
